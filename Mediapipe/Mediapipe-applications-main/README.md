# Finger-Gesture-Detection---Mediapipe (for testwebcam.py)
There is an example of using mediapipe for detecting the different types of finger gestures. This code can detect OK (circling gesture and three other fingers up) and LIKE (Thumb up with the punch)  gestures. 
This source code can be applied to software that requires the use of a webcam for interaction (such as Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) or can also be related to computer vision for purposes related to control and automation.
